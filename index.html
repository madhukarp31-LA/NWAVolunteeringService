    <h2>Cause Marketing</h2>
    <p>This is a form of marketing in which a company and a charity team up together to tackle a social or environmental problem and create business value for the company at the same time. Typically, in cause-related marketing campaigns, a brand is affiliated with a cause and a portion of the proceeds from the sales of the brand is donated to the cause.</p>

    <h2>Financials</h2>
    <p>The Arkansas NWA Volunatry  provides the most nutritious food through the most cost effective, efficient means possible for hungry Arkansans in our service area. We uphold our mission with the trust of our staff, board, donors, volunteers, recipients and partners. Because we receive strong support from donors in the community and the food industry, the Foodbank keeps administrative costs low—less than 4 cents on the dollar—and impact high. So 96 cents of every dollar donated to the NWA Volunatry Service goes directly into our hunger-relief programming, including food acquisition.</p>

    <h2>Hunger</h2>
    <p>1 in 5 Arkansans are food insecure. For children that number jumps to 1 in 4. What does being food insecure mean? At some point during the year—due to job loss, marital status, or natural disasters—your household is suddenly disrupted because you are without enough money and nearby resources to feed yourself or your family. This hunger simulation will allow you to experience a day in the life of a person facing hunger, and the heart wrenching decisions they must make daily to survive. Could you survive a day lived by neighbors facing hunger?</p>

    <h2>Arkansas Home Visiting Network</h2>
    <p>The Arkansas Home Visiting Network (AHVN) delivers family support programs often referred to as “home visiting” because they take place in the homes of vulnerable families. These voluntary programs match participants with trained providers from their own communities, such as nurses or parent educators, to help motivated parents learn better skills to be successful in their parenting. These programs have proven to be a sound strategy for strengthening families and aiding in child development. Our goal at the AHVN is to build stronger families and brighter futures for the children and communities of Arkansas.</p>
