    <h2>Cause Marketing</h2>
    <p>This is a form of marketing in which a company and a charity team up together to tackle a social or environmental problem and create business value for the company at the same time. Typically, in cause-related marketing campaigns, a brand is affiliated with a cause and a portion of the proceeds from the sales of the brand is donated to the cause.</p>

    <h2>Financials</h2>
    <p>The Arkansas NWA Volunatry  provides the most nutritious food through the most cost effective, efficient means possible for hungry Arkansans in our service area. We uphold our mission with the trust of our staff, board, donors, volunteers, recipients and partners. Because we receive strong support from donors in the community and the food industry, the Foodbank keeps administrative costs low—less than 4 cents on the dollar—and impact high. So 96 cents of every dollar donated to the NWA Volunatry Service goes directly into our hunger-relief programming, including food acquisition.</p>
