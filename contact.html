        <h2>Tutoring</h2>
        <p>Tutors are a key resource for all students and a great opportunity to engage in collaborative learning.</p>

        <h2>Course Specific Tutoring</h2>
        <p>For course-specific tutoring, professors recommend students to work as tutors and they are trained by the LEADS staff.  Typically, course-specific tutoring is done in small groups of two, and students can request a tutoring session through the Portal.</p>
        
        <h2>Individual Organizational Tutoring</h2>
        <p>When you need assistance with time management, prioritizing tasks, and staying motivated, organizational tutors can provide strategies and skills to help you succeed.  Organizational tutoring can be requested through the Portal.</p>
        <h1>What We Do</h1>
        
                
        <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
            Our mission is to improve educational outcomes and encourage a love of learning for students in underserved communities by providing free 1:1 tutoring, tailored to cultivate each student's individual academic, social and emotional growth as well as their artistic and intellectual interests. We provide free 1:1 virtual tutors to underserved students in the Los Angeles area. Our program supplements students' school-based learning. Volunteers help students with homework and language support, host group book clubs, and explore the arts. All tutors are background checked through Megan's Law, and tutoring takes place via Zoom. An empathetic heart, reliability, and subject proficiency are the principal requirements that we look for in our tutors.Students in low-income communities are not receiving opportunities to excel academically. Lack of funding, overcrowded classrooms, and high teacher turnover rates contributes to the gap because students are not receiving enough one-on-one attention. COVID-19 has exacerbated the already huge gap between economic classes. For example, hundreds of thousands of low-income students in Detroit do not have access to WIFI or computers, so they fell behind in online school.

            According to a recent article from Politico, in the poorest neighborhoods of Chicago, fewer 9th and 10th grade students with access to tutors failed, and majority improved almost a full letter grade. If more communities prioritized free tutoring programs, schools could work to close the socioeconomic achievement gap by leveling the educational playing field and providing access to quality education and personalized learning for children in need.
            
            By tutoring low income students online and in person, I hope to work towards closing this gap and above all build strong relationships with the students and help them enjoy learning. Please fill up the contact details forms if you would like to know about the services and the volunteer oppotunities.

          <h2>How to make homework less stressful</h2>
          <p>Many parents agree that, at times, it can be a challenge to get homework completed. Sitting down after a long school day may be the last thing your child wants to do. It might also feel like an augment not worth having when there are still a lot of to-dos left on the list for the day. But completing homework is crucial to academic progress. Homework assignments provide the necessary practice to continue developing a skill and mastering it.  </p>
          <p>Take note of how long it takes to complete homework </p>
          <p>Update the teacher on the homework completion time </p>
          <p>Have a weekly schedule and praise efforts</p>
